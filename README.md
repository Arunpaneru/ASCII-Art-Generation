# ASCII Image Processor

This project is an **ASCII Image Processor** that converts an image into grayscale, generates ASCII art from it, and saves the results as image files. 
The application is built in Go and uses the `golang.org/x/image` package for font rendering and image processing.

## Features

- Extract pixel data and RGB values from an image.
- Convert the image to grayscale using the **luminosity method**.
- Generate ASCII art representation of the grayscale image.
- Save the ASCII art and grayscale image as a PNG image.
